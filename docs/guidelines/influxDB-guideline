# Using InfluxDB with the "jetracer" Database

This document outlines the basic steps required to work with InfluxDB, including starting the CLI with proper timestamp precision and executing queries.

### Start the Influx CLI (all inside jetson nano)

Before running any queries, start the InfluxDB command-line interface with the following command to set the timestamp precision:

```bash
influx -precision rfc3339
```

### Select the database 


```bash
USE jetracer; 
```

### Querying Data

```bash
SELECT time, value FROM "Vehicle/1/Body/Lights/DirectionIndicator/Left";
```

### Additional Considerations
Time Filtering: You can refine your queries by filtering on time. For example, to retrieve data from the past hour:

```bash
SELECT time, value FROM "Vehicle/1/Body/Lights/DirectionIndicator/Left" WHERE time > now() - 1h;
```
