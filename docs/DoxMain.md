### **Doxygen Integration**

This document is part of the **Team02-Course** Doxygen-generated documentation. 

- Make sure the Doxyfile: (`MARKDOWN_SUPPORT = YES`) and scan correct directories.
- Ensure files formated correctly (png/svg/jpg) for Doxygen to render them properly.
- For responsive images, the `<img>` tags now use `style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"`.
