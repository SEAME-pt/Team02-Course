# ADR 0012: Logging Using Zenoh

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a reliable and efficient logging system to record and manage logs generated by our application. The logging system should support distributed environments and provide low-latency data access.

## Decision
We have decided to use Zenoh for logging. Zenoh is a protocol that unifies data in motion, data at rest, and computations. It is designed for high performance and low latency, making it suitable for our logging requirements. We will keep Zenoh as the logging system because we will connect an in-vehicle router and an off-vehicle router connected to InfluxDB, where we will be able to have real-time access to our in-car logs from the cloud.

## Consequences
- **Pros:**
    - High performance and low latency logging.
    - Supports distributed environments.
    - Unified protocol for data in motion and data at rest.

- **Cons:**
    - Requires learning and integrating a new protocol.
