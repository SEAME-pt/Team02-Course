# ADR 0004: Use VSS Convention for Syntax Naming

## Context
To ensure consistency and clarity in our codebase, we need a standardized naming convention for syntax.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) convention for syntax naming.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
    - Promotes uniformity across the project.
    - Aligns with industry standards.
    - Simplifies collaboration and onboarding.

- **Cons**:
    - Requires team members to familiarize themselves with VSS.
    - Potential refactoring of existing code to comply with the convention.

## Status
Accepted.
