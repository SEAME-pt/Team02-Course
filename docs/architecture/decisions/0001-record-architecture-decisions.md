# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). In addition, we will use adr tools connected to git to simplify the way we create and write ADR's based on a template. 

## Consequences
See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
